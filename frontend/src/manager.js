/**
 * The socket and event manager for CritterChat's frontend. The various major components of the
 * frontend are created here and managed from within this class. Only the manager handles socket
 * communications. Everything else handles communication via events which are broadcast for one
 * of two purposes. The first purpose is for the manager to handle some request, such as loading
 * chat history when we navigate to a new chat. The second purpose is to inform systems that
 * something has happened, such as the user toggling info or a notification occurring. This helps
 * keep various components decoupled and handling only their section of the UI while allowing
 * the components to interact with each other when necessary.
 *
 * For the above to work, we create an event bus that gets passed to all components of the UI
 * as they are created. Anyone can emit events to this event bus, and anyone can listen for
 * events that they care about on this event bus. For the majority of events, there is only
 * really one emitter and one listener. But that still allows us to keep the various components
 * decoupled and only broadcast intents and requests.
 *
 * We also handle global input and screen state in the manager. The input state is the state
 * of any typeahead/autocomplete popover or emoji search popover that the user might be interacting
 * with at any given time. Because only one is allowed open at once, we handle informing the two
 * systems that one should close should the other be opened by allowing both to register input
 * state listeners. Similarly, when in mobile mode we only display one screen at a time. Therefore
 * the various screens would need to coordinate transitioning between each other. We do so using
 * the screen state which allows the various components to coordinate passing UI control between
 * each other depending on user request.
